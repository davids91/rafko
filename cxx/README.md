# C++ - Sparse Net Library
This folder contains the backbone of the Neural network calculation library. 
The C++ parts are made to implement a server for Neural Network operations.
It shall ommunicate mainly with the Client implementations in other languages, 
providing services for: 

 - Neural networ creation
 - Neural network solution 
 - Neural network optimization

## Dependencies: 

 - pkg-config
 - protocol buffers (proto3 compatible)
